     Deep within the deserts of Jordan
     lies the ancient city of Petra.
     Through a narrow gorge it emerges
     into view, revealing awe-inspiring
     monuments cut into the surrounding
     cliffs. What is this astonishing
     city? Who built it, and why?
     Two thousand years ago, Petra stood at a
crossroads of the ancient Near East.Camel caravans
passed through, loaded with spices, textiles and
incense from distant regions--and through such
commerce, the city flourished. Its people, the
Nabataeans, harnessed precious water, enabling the
population to soar to perhaps 20,000.
      Re-discovering this astounding complex of cliff-carved
          fa√ßades as Swiss explorer, Johann Ludwig
          Burckhardt, did exactly 200 years ago must surely
          have been well worth writing home about. Now well
          known to the world - in no small part due to its
          on-screenrole in 'Indiana Jones and the Last
          Crusade' - and in company with the likes of
          Cambodia's Angkor Wat, Peru's Machu Picchu, and
          the Great Wall of China on the list of 'New 7
          Wondersof the World', it is thrilling to imagine
          what this intrepid explorer must have felt on
          first seeing Petra.
